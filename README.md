Examples for the nippy manuscript.

This repository contains two examples of how to use `nippy` to batch preprocess near infrared spectroscopic data. Data for example 1 was taken from 
```
Kosmowski, Frédéric, and Tigist Worku. "Evaluation of a miniaturized NIR spectrometer for cultivar identification: The case of barley, chickpea and sorghum in Ethiopia." PloS one 13.3 (2018): e0193620.
```
Data for example 2 was taken from
```
Sarin, Jaakko K., et al. "Dataset on equine cartilage near infrared spectra, composition, and functional properties." Scientific data 6.1 (2019): 1-8.
```

### How to run the examples:

1. Install `nippy`
2. Clone this repository
3. Download the appropriate datasets
4. Run `example_1.py` or `example_2.py` in Python 3.6+
5. Different preprocessing operations can be tested by modifying the accompanying INI-files
